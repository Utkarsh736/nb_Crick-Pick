# Crick-Pick: Cricket vs Baseball Image Classifier

## Project Overview

Crick-Pick is an image classification project that distinguishes between cricket and baseball images. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks exploring various machine learning and deep learning techniques to build and optimize the classifier.

## Project Goals

1. Implement and compare different ML/DL techniques for image classification
2. Analyze the performance of various models on a small dataset (30 images per class)
3. Identify the best-performing model for deployment
<!---
## Notebooks

The project consists of multiple notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of the model development process:

1. `01_baseline_model.ipynb`: Implementation of a baseline ResNet18 model
2. `02_custom_cnn.ipynb`: Building and training a custom CNN architecture
3. `03_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance
4. `04_data_augmentation.ipynb`: Exploring data augmentation techniques, including presizing
5. `05_model_visualization.ipynb`: Visualizing model performance and decision-making process
-->
## Techniques (To Be) Explored

- Transfer Learning with ResNet18
- Custom CNN Architecture
- Hyperparameter Optimization
- Data Augmentation (Presizing)
- Model Interpretation and Visualization

## Future Work

The best-performing model from this project will be used to build a web application using Gradio. This app will allow users to upload images and receive real-time classifications distinguishing between cricket and baseball scenes.
